# Restaurant Menager Applicaton
This web application is used to create a digital representation of customers restaurant. The client can choose number of tables, then create his own products, with prices, and then add those products to the specific tables.
You have the option to clear the tables (check out) and again add products to tables. It has responsive UI and is easly used.
# First Web App Project
This is my first full stack project created as faculty assigment, and it is done in OOP Javascript as front end technology, ASP.NET and SQL LiveServer as back end and database technologies. It is created a while ago, and
i dont have live preview of the website, and also database used for development are not in use, so it is just a code showoff project.
